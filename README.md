#Data Description 
In both networks a The system was tuned so that whenever two individuals wearing the RFID tags were in face-to-face proximity(<1.5m) the probability to detect such a proximity event over an time interval of 20 seconds was larger than 99%.  

Most of the data follows the general format node_1, node_2, Date_time. Where the time interval for which the contact was active is [ t – 20s, t ] (i.e for Date_time of July, 3rd 05:24:20, this represents the time interval from 05:24:00 - 05:24:20)
